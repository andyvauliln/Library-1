This library has evolved from [@21xhipster](https://github.com/21xhipster) research path and initially includes the stuff he met. The library consist of 100+ useful (probably the most impactful) academy materials from the following fields:

- SAI. Consensus computers, blockchains and other super intelligent live forms.
- GAI. Deep learning, neural cryptography, cryptoeconomics
- Computer brain interfaces. Discovering capabilities of EEG, MEG and open source tools like Open BCI.
- VR/AR. OSVR, HTC Vive, Hololens and Tango related researches.
- 3d printing. Researching possibilities behind three dimensional printing.
- Autonomous robotics. Self aware, self replicating, economically independent physical entities.
- Biological engineering. DNA sequencing => Biological circuits => CRISPR
- Space exploration. Making humans multiplanetary ...
- Sustainable energy. Advancements in solar, wind, geothermal energy generation and ways of storing energy.
- Transportation. Hyperloop, BFR and so on.
- Mesh networks. SDR, high performant consensus, lightning networks that advance abundant internet to the planet and beyond.

It does not pretend to be precise or full. It includes only papers which are (1) freely published and easy accessible and (2) was met by [@21xhipster](https://github.com/21xhipster)  :-)

The library is work in progress and hopefully lay the foundation of cyberâ€¢Fund R&D activities.
